Dear NHTSA,

I am writing to express my opinion on the use of mailed recall notices for Tesla vehicles, specifically regarding software-related updates. While I understand the importance of informing car owners about safety risks, I believe the current process for Tesla recalls, which primarily involve software updates, requires reevaluation.

My concern lies in the environmental and financial implications of sending physical mail for software updates. As all Tesla recalls in 2024 have been software-related, requiring no physical repairs, these mailings seem unnecessary. They contribute to paper waste and utilize resources for shipping and handling, creating an avoidable financial burden for the NHTSA.

Instead, I propose exploring alternative notification methods for software updates:

In-vehicle notifications: Utilize existing Tesla dashboard features to display prominent and persistent recall alerts, prompting owners to download the update directly through their vehicle's internet connection.
Mobile app notifications: Leverage the Tesla mobile app to send push notifications about recalls, providing clear instructions and access to update downloads within the app.
Email notifications: For owners lacking in-vehicle connectivity or the app, email with clear instructions and a link to download the update online could be used as a last resort.
These methods are environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and ensure timely information reaches owners without relying on physical mail. They also align with Tesla's technology-driven approach, maximizing reach and effectiveness.

Of course, some owners might require assistance accessing or installing the update. In such cases, offering dedicated support channels (hotlines, online tutorials) alongside the digital notifications could address these concerns.

I urge the NHTSA to consider this proposal and explore its feasibility. By adopting these alternative methods for software-related recalls, we can ensure safety communication while promoting environmental responsibility and efficient use of resources.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
